# Hello, I am Stavro
I have been working as an Android Developer for around 6 years professionally now. I have a Bachelors degree in Information Technology, but I only worked as an IT specialist my first year of the career. Programming pays better. After a 3 year experience in my homeland, Albania, I decided to move to Germany for a better professional life. 
Currently, I work at AppsFactory's Munich branch. It's a software agency and I work with big clients like BMW, Mercedes, VW etc. As you already guessed, yes: I work in the automotive industry. Previously I worked at Quickbird Studios, also located in Munich in the medical field, outsourcing product companies who wanted to help their clients with diabetes.

## Android journey
I started with Android professionally at the end of 2017 and since then I have been developing Android apps, writing blog posts, helping other developers in Stack Overflow and lately providing video content for newbies to learn from the technology that I use best.

I like to create high quality Android apps. Architecture is and always will be one of the main discussion points in this framework, since Android is not that simple anyways.

## Professional career
To take a look at all my professional journey, please head over to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stavro-xhardha-64b98a153/) profile. Should you have any questions, feel free to send a direct message over there.

## Social life
Muslim. Married. It's worth to mention that any oppinion I state (technical or not technical) is my own and doesn't represent any current company that I am working in.
I do not aspire to become only a good software programmer, but rather a polymath. I am curious about a lot of stuff. My dream job has been to work in Google as an Android expert, but lately i have changed my mind and now I want to create my own product company. Not sure if I can be a good CEO, but since my communication skills are quite high, therefore I think I can take any responsibility that my job covers and also become a leader.
